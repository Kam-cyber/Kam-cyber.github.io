        <br> I visit the Barrio Antiguo in Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n. I'm not much for going out to explore new places, but honestly this place captivated me.
    <br>
        </p>
         <p>
        <br> 
        Perhaps it is the most bohemian place in Monterrey, because you see art everywhere, in the houses, restaurants, items they offer, in the music, it is as a magical place.
    <br>
        </p>
        <p>
        <br> 
        The Old Town has managed to maintain the essence of "old", this through the colorful architecture present in each of the houses that surround the streets, side by side.
    <br>
        </p>
        <p>
        <br> 
        This is a place where you can spend the afternoon, walking through the streets, surrounding yourself with colors and allegorical music. In my experience I felt like I was traveling to the past, getting lost among so many colors, the smell of the restaurants as you pass by, the music that accompanies your trip, it is something unmatched.
    <br>
        </p>
        <p>
        <br> I do not leave aside the beautiful crafts that the small businesses sell in that place, too many worthy crafts to appreciate. Each one representing Mexico in all its splendor.
        <br>
        </p>
        
        <h2>Places where I ate in Barrio Antiguo!</h2>

        <br> I can't deny that the food at this place is so delicious, full of flavor, colors and extremely traditional. Some of the foods I was able to find are the typical enchiladas, entomatadas, drowned tacos, mole, etc. Each of these meals is an explosion of flavor on the palate!
        <br>
        </p>
        <p>
        <br>Some of the places I visited are: La Sirena Embarazada, Trece Lunas, Matarile and ESTAQUEARDE. I loved these places because they sell delicious food, and also desserts, that leave you wanting to eat more.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        <br>Personally, I would go to that place countless times and never get tired of it, I would explore the place with excitement as if I had never seen it. If you like adventures and spend hours immersed in a place, this is the perfect place. And believe me, you won't get bored, like me.<br>
